## Description

The purpose of this lab is to set up and deploy an application on Heroku with Node.js. The application consists of a calculator with operations for two numbers that are filled in by the user. The operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. The front-end reads the user input and makes an API call to the back-end by calling for example `api/add` for adding the two numbers. The server response with the result is displayed for the user to read.
